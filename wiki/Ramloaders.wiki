= Details =
  * *V9m Sprint Monster (from 02.68.00R)* - Displays image and flash status in a proportional font ("Flashing Phn Code", "Flashing EFS"), may not support 0x04000000 flexing because it's not an upgrade ramloader.
  * *V9m DST Upgrade* - Blue background, displays brief phone status in bitmap font; used in my test code-only flash to much success.
